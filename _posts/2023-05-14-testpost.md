Welcome to my "One Example a Day" collection. Here, I'll post interesting (at least to me...) small problems that arise in my reading and/or research, as well as examples I work out. I'll also try to provide a bit of context before giving the full problem, so things aren't _entirely_ unmotivated.

Of course, I'm only human; if you, dear reader, happen to find errors in my proofs and/or issues with my exposition, please don't hesitate to contact me via my email.

The first [example](https://trvkdb.github.io/files/examples/ex1.pdf) is a simple convolution estimate. As shown above, it shows that (in some sense) we can pull the slower-decaying piece (corresponding to the power $\beta$) out of the integral, and then integrate the remainder. 

It's not mentioned in the proof, but the modification to the proof for sums rather than integral is to replace all integrals with sums and subsequently redefine everything in terms of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ rather than $\mathbb{R}$.
