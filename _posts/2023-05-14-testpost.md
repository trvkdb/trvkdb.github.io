Welcome to my "One Example a Day" collection. Here, I'll post interesting (at least to me...) small problems that arise in my reading and/or research, as well as examples I work out. I'll also try to provide a bit of context before giving the full problem, so things aren't _entirely_ unmotivated.

Of course, I'm only human; if you, dear reader, happen to find errors in my proofs and/or issues with my exposition, please don't hesitate to contact me via my email.

The first [example](../files/examples/ex1.pdf) is a simple convolution estimate; in what follows, we'll use the Japanese bracket notation $\langle x \rangle := (1+|x|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}$. The estimate we want to prove is the following (we only state it for integrals, but a similar result holds for sums):
