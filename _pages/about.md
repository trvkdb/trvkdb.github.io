Welcome to my website! I am a master's student in mathematics at [Missouri S&T](math.mst.edu) under the direction of [Dr. Jason Murphy](https://web.mst.edu/~jcmcfd/). I am broadly interested in nonlinear dispersive PDE and stochastic PDE. 

In the fall of 2022, I am starting my PhD in mathematics at UNC Chapel Hill.
